      CHAPTER LXII
    </h2>
<h3>
      WHAT'S TO BE DONE NEXT?
    </h3>
<p>
      It was twilight when they arrived in town; and having shaken off his
      companions, and walked through a good many streets to avoid the
      possibility of being traced by them, Edward took a hackney-coach and drove
      to Colonel Talbot's house, in one of the principal squares at the west end
      of the town. That gentleman, by the death of relations, had succeeded
      since his marriage to a large fortune, possessed considerable political
      interest, and lived in what is called great style.
    </p>
<p>
      When Waverley knocked at his door he found it at first difficult to
      procure admittance, but at length was shown into an apartment where the
      Colonel was at table. Lady Emily, whose very beautiful features were still
      pallid from indisposition, sate opposite to him. The instant he heard
      Waverley's voice, he started up and embraced him. 'Frank Stanley, my dear
      boy, how d'ye do? Emily, my love, this is young Stanley.'
    </p>
<p>
      The blood started to the lady's cheek as she gave Waverley a reception in
      which courtesy was mingled with kindness, while her trembling hand and
      faltering voice showed how much she was startled and discomposed. Dinner
      was hastily replaced, and while Waverley was engaged in refreshing
      himself, the Colonel proceeded—'I wonder you have come here, Frank;
      the Doctors tell me the air of London is very bad for your complaints. You
      should not have risked it. But I am delighted to see you, and so is Emily,
      though I fear we must not reckon upon your staying long.'
    </p>
<p>
      'Some particular business brought me up,' muttered Waverley.
    </p>
<p>
      'I supposed so, but I shan't allow you to stay long. Spontoon' (to an
      elderly military-looking servant out of livery), 'take away these things,
      and answer the bell yourself, if I ring. Don't let any of the other
      fellows disturb us. My nephew and I have business to talk of.'
    </p>
<p>
      When the servants had retired, 'In the name of God, Waverley, what has
      brought you here? It may be as much as your life is worth.'
    </p>
<p>
      'Dear Mr. Waverley,' said Lady Emily, 'to whom I owe so much more than
      acknowledgments can ever pay, how could you be so rash?'
    </p>
<p>
      'My father—my uncle—this paragraph,'—he handed the paper
      to Colonel Talbot.
    </p>
<p>
      'I wish to Heaven these scoundrels were condemned to be squeezed to death
      in their own presses,' said Talbot. 'I am told there are not less than a
      dozen of their papers now published in town, and no wonder that they are
      obliged to invent lies to find sale for their journals. It is true,
      however, my dear Edward, that you have lost your father; but as to this
      flourish of his unpleasant situation having grated upon his spirits and
      hurt his health—the truth is—for though it is harsh to say so
      now, yet it will relieve your mind from the idea of weighty responsibility—the
      truth then is, that Mr. Richard Waverley, through this whole business,
      showed great want of sensibility, both to your situation and that of your
      uncle; and the last time I saw him, he told me, with great glee, that, as
      I was so good as to take charge of your interests, he had thought it best
      to patch up a separate negotiation for himself, and make his peace with
      government through some channels which former connexions left still open
      to him.'
    </p>
<p>
      'And my uncle, my dear uncle?'
    </p>
<p>
      'Is in no danger whatever. It is true (looking at the date of the paper)
      there was a foolish report some time ago to the purport here quoted, but
      it is entirely false. Sir Everard is gone down to Waverley-Honour, freed
      from all uneasiness, unless upon your own account. But you are in peril
      yourself; your name is in every proclamation; warrants are out to
      apprehend you. How and when did you come here?'
    </p>
<p>
      Edward told his story at length, suppressing his quarrel with Fergus; for,
      being himself partial to Highlanders, he did not wish to give any
      advantage to the Colonel's national prejudice against them.
    </p>
<p>
      'Are you sure it was your friend Glen's foot-boy you saw dead in Clifton
      Moor?'
    </p>
<p>
      'Quite positive.'
    </p>
<p>
      'Then that little limb of the devil has cheated the gallows, for
      cut-throat was written in his face; though (turning to Lady Emily) it was
      a very handsome face too. But for you, Edward, I wish you would go down
      again to Cumberland, or rather I wish you had never stirred from thence,
      for there is an embargo in all the seaports, and a strict search for the
      adherents of the Pretender; and the tongue of that confounded woman will
      wag in her head like the clack of a mill, till somehow or other she will
      detect Captain Butler to be a feigned personage.'
    </p>
<p>
      'Do you know anything,' asked Waverley, 'of my fellow-traveller?'
    </p>
<p>
      'Her husband was my sergeant-major for six years; she was a buxom widow,
      with a little money; he married her, was steady, and got on by being a
      good drill. I must send Spontoon to see what she is about; he will find
      her out among the old regimental connections. To-morrow you must be
      indisposed, and keep your room from fatigue. Lady Emily is to be your
      nurse, and Spontoon and I your attendants. You bear the name of a near
      relation of mine, whom none of my present people ever saw, except
      Spontoon, so there will be no immediate danger. So pray feel your head
      ache and your eyes grow heavy as soon as possible, that you may be put
      upon the sick-list; and, Emily, do you order an apartment for Frank
      Stanley, with all the attentions which an invalid may require.'
    </p>
<p>
      In the morning the Colonel visited his guest. 'Now,' said he, 'I have some
      good news for you. Your reputation as a gentleman and officer is
      effectually cleared of neglect of duty and accession to the mutiny in
      Gardiner's regiment. I have had a correspondence on this subject with a
      very zealous friend of yours, your Scottish parson, Morton; his first
      letter was addressed to Sir Everard; but I relieved the good Baronet of
      the trouble of answering it. You must know, that your free-booting
      acquaintance, Donald of the Cave, has at length fallen into the hands of
      the Philistines. He was driving off the cattle of a certain proprietor,
      called Killan—something or other—'
    </p>
<p>
      'Killancureit?'
    </p>
<p>
      'The same. Now the gentleman being, it seems, a great farmer, and having a
      special value for his breed of cattle, being, moreover, rather of a timid
      disposition, had got a party of soldiers to protect his property. So
      Donald ran his head unawares into the lion's mouth, and was defeated and
      made prisoner. Being ordered for execution, his conscience was assailed on
      the one hand by a Catholic priest, on the other by your friend Morton. He
      repulsed the Catholic chiefly on account of the doctrine of extreme
      unction, which this economical gentleman considered as an excessive waste
      of oil. So his conversion from a state of impenitence fell to Mr. Morton's
      share, who, I daresay, acquitted himself excellently, though I suppose
      Donald made but a queer kind of Christian after all. He confessed,
      however, before a magistrate, one Major Melville, who seems to have been a
      correct, friendly sort of person, his full intrigue with Houghton,
      explaining particularly how it was carried on, and fully acquitting you of
      the least accession to it. He also mentioned his rescuing you from the
      hands of the volunteer officer, and sending you, by orders of the Pret—Chevalier,
      I mean—as a prisoner to Doune, from whence he understood you were
      carried prisoner to Edinburgh. These are particulars which cannot but tell
      in your favour. He hinted that he had been employed to deliver and protect
      you, and rewarded for doing so; but he would not confess by whom, alleging
      that, though he would not have minded breaking any ordinary oath to
      satisfy the curiosity of Mr. Morton, to whose pious admonitions he owed so
      much, yet, in the present case he had been sworn to silence upon the edge
      of his dirk, [Footnote: See Note 38.] which, it seems, constituted, in his
      opinion, an inviolable obligation.'
    </p>
<p>
      'And what is become of him?'
    </p>
<p>
      'Oh, he was hanged at Stirling after the rebels raised the siege, with his
      lieutenant and four plaids besides; he having the advantage of a gallows
      more lofty than his friends.'
    </p>
<p>
      'Well, I have little cause either to regret or rejoice at his death; and
      yet he has done me both good and harm to a very considerable extent.'
    </p>
<p>
      'His confession, at least, will serve you materially, since it wipes from
      your character all those suspicions which gave the accusation against you
      a complexion of a nature different from that with which so many
      unfortunate gentlemen, now or lately in arms against the government, may
      be justly charged. Their treason—I must give it its name, though you
      participate in its guilt—is an action arising from mistaken virtue,
      and therefore cannot be classed as a disgrace, though it be doubtless
      highly criminal. Where the guilty are so numerous, clemency must be
      extended to far the greater number; and I have little doubt of procuring a
      remission for you, providing we can keep you out of the claws of justice
      till she has selected and gorged upon her victims; for in this, as in
      other cases, it will be according to the vulgar proverb, “First come,
      first served.” Besides, government are desirous at present to intimidate
      the English Jacobites, among whom they can find few examples for
      punishment. This is a vindictive and timid feeling which will soon wear
      off, for of all nations the English are least blood-thirsty by nature. But
      it exists at present, and you must therefore be kept out of the way in the
      mean-time.'
    </p>
<p>
      Now entered Spontoon with an anxious countenance. By his regimental
      acquaintances he had traced out Madam Nosebag, and found her full of ire,
      fuss, and fidget at discovery of an impostor who had travelled from the
      north with her under the assumed name of Captain Butler of Gardiner's
      dragoons. She was going to lodge an information on the subject, to have
      him sought for as an emissary of the Pretender; but Spontoon (an old
      soldier), while he pretended to approve, contrived to make her delay her
      intention. No time, however, was to be lost: the accuracy of this good
      dame's description might probably lead to the discovery that Waverley was
      the pretended Captain Butler, an identification fraught with danger to
      Edward, perhaps to his uncle, and even to Colonel Talbot. Which way to
      direct his course was now, therefore, the question.
    </p>
<p>
      'To Scotland,' said Waverley.
    </p>
<p>
      'To Scotland?' said the Colonel; 'with what purpose? not to engage again
      with the rebels, I hope?'
    </p>
<p>
      'No; I considered my campaign ended when, after all my efforts, I could
      not rejoin them; and now, by all accounts, they are gone to make a winter
      campaign in the Highlands, where such adherents as I am would rather be
      burdensome than useful. Indeed, it seems likely that they only prolong the
      war to place the Chevalier's person out of danger, and then to make some
      terms for themselves. To burden them with my presence would merely add
      another party, whom they would not give up and could not defend. I
      understand they left almost all their English adherents in garrison at
      Carlisle, for that very reason. And on a more general view, Colonel, to
      confess the truth, though it may lower me in your opinion, I am heartly
      tired of the trade of war, and am, as Fletcher's Humorous Lieutenant says,
      “even as weary of this fighting-'”
     </p>
<p>
      'Fighting! pooh, what have you seen but a skirmish or two? Ah! if you saw
      war on the grand scale—sixty or a hundred thousand men in the field
      on each side!'
    </p>
<p>
      'I am not at all curious, Colonel. “Enough,” says our homely proverb, “is
      as good as a feast.” The plumed troops and the big war used to enchant me
      in poetry, but the night marches, vigils, couches under the wintry sky,
      and such accompaniments of the glorious trade, are not at all to my taste
      in practice; then for dry blows, I had MY fill of fighting at Clifton,
      where I escaped by a hair's-breadth half a dozen times; and you, I should
      think—' He stopped.
    </p>
<p>
      'Had enough of it at Preston? you mean to say,' answered the Colonel,
      laughing; 'but 'tis my vocation, Hal.'
    </p>
<p>
      'It is not mine, though,' said Waverley; 'and having honourably got rid of
      the sword, which I drew only as a volunteer, I am quite satisfied with my
      military experience, and shall be in no hurry to take it up again.'
    </p>
<p>
      'I am very glad you are of that mind; but then what would you do in the
      north?'
    </p>
<p>
      'In the first place, there are some seaports on the eastern coast of
      Scotland still in the hands of the Chevalier's friends; should I gain any
      of them, I can easily embark for the Continent.'
    </p>
<p>
      'Good, your second reason?'
    </p>
<p>
      'Why, to speak the very truth, there is a person in Scotland upon whom I
      now find my happiness depends more than I was always aware, and about
      whose situation I am very anxious.'
    </p>
<p>
      'Then Emily was right, and there is a love affair in the case after all?
      And which of these two pretty Scotchwomen, whom you insisted upon my
      admiring, is the distinguished fair? not Miss Glen—I hope.'
    </p>
<p>
      'No.'
    </p>
<p>
      'Ah, pass for the other; simplicity may be improved, but pride and conceit
      never. Well, I don't discourage you; I think it will please Sir Everard,
      from what he said when I jested with him about it; only I hope that
      intolerable papa, with his brogue, and his snuff, and his Latin, and his
      insufferable long stories about the Duke of Berwick, will find it
      necessary hereafter to be an inhabitant of foreign parts. But as to the
      daughter, though I think you might find as fitting a match in England, yet
      if your heart be really set upon this Scotch rosebud, why the Baronet has
      a great opinion of her father and of his family, and he wishes much to see
      you married and settled, both for your own sake and for that of the three
      ermines passant, which may otherwise pass away altogether. But I will
      bring you his mind fully upon the subject, since you are debarred
      correspondence for the present, for I think you will not be long in
      Scotland before me.'
    </p>
<p>
      'Indeed! and what can induce you to think of returning to Scotland? No
      relenting longings towards the land of mountains and floods, I am afraid.'
    </p>
<p>
      'None, on my word; but Emily's health is now, thank God, reestablished,
      and, to tell you the truth, I have little hopes of concluding the business
      which I have at present most at heart until I can have a personal
      interview with his Royal Highness the Commander-in-Chief; for, as Fluellen
      says, “the duke doth love me well, and I thank heaven I have deserved some
      love at his hands.” I am now going out for an hour or two to arrange
      matters for your departure; your liberty extends to the next room, Lady
      Emily's parlour, where you will find her when you are disposed for music,
      reading, or conversation. We have taken measures to exclude all servants
      but Spontoon, who is as true as steel.'
    </p>
<p>
      In about two hours Colonel Talbot returned, and found his young friend
      conversing with his lady; she pleased with his manners and information,
      and he delighted at being restored, though but for a moment, to the
      society of his own rank, from which he had been for some time excluded.
    </p>
<p>
      'And now,' said the Colonel, 'hear my arrangements, for there is little
      time to lose. This youngster, Edward Waverley, alias Williams, alias
      Captain Butler, must continue to pass by his fourth ALIAS of Francis
      Stanley, my nephew; he shall set out to-morrow for the North, and the
      chariot shall take him the first two stages. Spontoon shall then attend
      him; and they shall ride post as far as Huntingdon; and the presence of
      Spontoon, well known on the road as my servant, will check all disposition
      to inquiry. At Huntingdon you will meet the real Frank Stanley. He is
      studying at Cambridge; but, a little while ago, doubtful if Emily's health
      would permit me to go down to the North myself, I procured him a passport
      from the secretary of state's office to go in my stead. As he went chiefly
      to look after you, his journey is now unnecessary. He knows your story;
      you will dine together at Huntingdon; and perhaps your wise heads may hit
      upon some plan for removing or diminishing the danger of your farther
      progress north-ward. And now (taking out a morocco case), let me put you
      in funds for the campaign.'
    </p>
<p>
      'I am ashamed, my dear Colonel—'
    </p>
<p>
      'Nay,' said Colonel Talbot, 'you should command my purse in any event; but
      this money is your own. Your father, considering the chance of your being
      attainted, left me his trustee for your advantage. So that you are worth
      above L15,000, besides Brere-Wood Lodge—a very independent person, I
      promise you. There are bills here for L200; any larger sum you may have,
      or credit abroad, as soon as your motions require it.'
    </p>
<p>
      The first use which occurred to Waverley of his newly acquired wealth was
      to write to honest Farmer Jopson, requesting his acceptance of a silver
      tankard on the part of his friend Williams, who had not forgotten the
      night of the eighteenth December last. He begged him at the same time
      carefully to preserve for him his Highland garb and accoutrements,
      particularly the arms, curious in themselves, and to which the friendship
      of the donors gave additional value. Lady Emily undertook to find some
      suitable token of remembrance likely to flatter the vanity and please the
      taste of Mrs. Williams; and the Colonel, who was a kind of farmer,
      promised to send the Ullswater patriarch an excellent team of horses for
      cart and plough.
    </p>
<p>
      One happy day Waverley spent in London; and, travelling in the manner
      projected, he met with Frank Stanley at Huntingdon. The two young men were
      acquainted in a minute.
    </p>
<p>
      'I can read my uncle's riddle,' said Stanley; 'the cautious old soldier did
      not care to hint to me that I might hand over to you this passport, which
      I have no occasion for; but if it should afterwards come out as the
      rattle-pated trick of a young Cantab, cela ne tire a rien. You are
      therefore to be Francis Stanley, with this passport.' This proposal
      appeared in effect to alleviate a great part of the difficulties which
      Edward must otherwise have encountered at every turn; and accordingly he
      scrupled not to avail himself of it, the more especially as he had
      discarded all political purposes from his present journey, and could not
      be accused of furthering machinations against the government while
      travelling under protection of the secretary's passport.
    </p>
<p>
      The day passed merrily away. The young student was inquisitive about
      Waverley's campaigns, and the manners of the Highlands, and Edward was
      obliged to satisfy his curiosity by whistling a pibroch, dancing a
      strathspey, and singing a Highland song. The next morning Stanley rode a
      stage northward with his new friend, and parted from him with great
      reluctance, upon the remonstrances of Spontoon, who, accustomed to submit
      to discipline, was rigid in enforcing it.
