<h2>
      CHAPTER LIII
    </h2>
<h3>
      FERGUS A SUITOR
    </h3>
<p>
      Waverley had, indeed, as he looked closer into the state of the
      Chevalier's court, less reason to be satisfied with it. It contained, as
      they say an acorn includes all the ramifications of the future oak, as
      many seeds of tracasserie and intrigue as might have done honour to the
      court of a large empire. Every person of consequence had some separate
      object, which he pursued with a fury that Waverley considered as
      altogether disproportioned to its importance. Almost all had their reasons
      for discontent, although the most legitimate was that of the worthy old
      Baron, who was only distressed on account of the common cause.
    </p>
<p>
      'We shall hardly,' said he one morning to Waverley when they had been
      viewing the Castle—'we shall hardly gain the obsidional crown, which
      you wot well was made of the roots or grain which takes root within the
      place besieged, or it may be of the herb woodbind, parietaria, or
      pellitory; we shall not, I say, gain it by this same blockade or leaguer
      of Edinburgh Castle.' For this opinion he gave most learned and
      satisfactory reasons, that the reader may not care to hear repeated.
    </p>
<p>
      Having escaped from the old gentleman, Waverley went to Fergus's lodgings
      by appointment, to await his return from Holyrood House. 'I am to have a
      particular audience to-morrow,' said Fergus to Waverley overnight, 'and
      you must meet me to wish me joy of the success which I securely
      anticipate.'
    </p>
<p>
      The morrow came, and in the Chief's apartment he found Ensign Maccombich
      waiting to make report of his turn of duty in a sort of ditch which they
      had dug across the Castle-hill and called a trench. In a short time the
      Chief's voice was heard on the stair in a tone of impatient fury: 'Callum!
      why, Callum Beg! Diaoul!' He entered the room with all the marks of a man
      agitated by a towering passion; and there were few upon whose features
      rage produced a more violent effect. The veins of his forehead swelled
      when he was in such agitation; his nostril became dilated; his cheek and
      eye inflamed; and his look that of a demoniac. These appearances of
      half-suppressed rage were the more frightful because they were obviously
      caused by a strong effort to temper with discretion an almost ungovernable
      paroxysm of passion, and resulted from an internal conflict of the most
      dreadful kind, which agitated his whole frame of mortality.
    </p>
<p>
      As he entered the apartment he unbuckled his broadsword, and throwing it
      down with such violence that the weapon rolled to the other end of the
      room, 'I know not what,' he exclaimed, 'withholds me from taking a solemn
      oath that I will never more draw it in his cause. Load my pistols, Callum,
      and bring them hither instantly—instantly!' Callum, whom nothing
      ever startled, dismayed, or disconcerted, obeyed very coolly. Evan Dhu,
      upon whose brow the suspicion that his Chief had been insulted called up a
      corresponding storm, swelled in sullen silence, awaiting to learn where or
      upon whom vengeance was to descend.
    </p>
<p>
      'So, Waverley, you are there,' said the Chief, after a moment's
      recollection. 'Yes, I remember I asked you to share my triumph, and you
      have come to witness my disappointment we shall call it.' Evan now
      presented the written report he had in his hand, which Fergus threw from
      him with great passion. 'I wish to God,' he said, 'the old den would
      tumble down upon the heads of the fools who attack and the knaves who
      defend it! I see, Waverley, you think I am mad. Leave us, Evan, but be
      within call.'
    </p>
<p>
      'The Colonel's in an unco kippage,' said Mrs. Flockhart to Evan as he
      descended; 'I wish he may be weel,—the very veins on his brent brow
      are swelled like whipcord; wad he no tak something?'
    </p>
<p>
      'He usually lets blood for these fits,' answered the Highland ancient with
      great composure.
    </p>
<p>
      When this officer left the room, the Chieftain gradually reassumed some
      degree of composure. 'I know, Waverley,' he said, 'that Colonel Talbot has
      persuaded you to curse ten times a day your engagement with us; nay, never
      deny it, for I am at this moment tempted to curse my own. Would you
      believe it, I made this very morning two suits to the Prince, and he has
      rejected them both; what do you think of it?'
    </p>
<p>
      'What can I think,' answered Waverley, 'till I know what your requests
      were?' 'Why, what signifies what they were, man? I tell you it was I that
      made them—I to whom he owes more than to any three who have joined
      the standard; for I negotiated the whole business, and brought in all the
      Perthshire men when not one would have stirred. I am not likely, I think,
      to ask anything very unreasonable, and if I did, they might have stretched
      a point. Well, but you shall know all, now that I can draw my breath again
      with some freedom. You remember my earl's patent; it is dated some years
      back, for services then rendered; and certainly my merit has not been
      diminished, to say the least, by my subsequent behaviour. Now, sir, I
      value this bauble of a coronet as little as you can, or any philosopher on
      earth; for I hold that the chief of such a clan as the Sliochd nan Ivor is
      superior in rank to any earl in Scotland. But I had a particular reason
      for assuming this cursed title at this time. You must know that I learned
      accidentally that the Prince has been pressing that old foolish Baron of
      Bradwardine to disinherit his male heir, or nineteenth or twentieth
      cousin, who has taken a command in the Elector of Hanover's militia, and
      to settle his estate upon your pretty little friend Rose; and this, as
      being the command of his king and overlord, who may alter the destination
      of a fief at pleasure, the old gentleman seems well reconciled to.'
    </p>
<p>
      'And what becomes of the homage?'
    </p>
<p>
      'Curse the homage! I believe Rose is to pull off the queen's slipper on
      her coronation-day, or some such trash. Well, sir, as Rose Bradwardine
      would always have made a suitable match for me but for this idiotical
      predilection of her father for the heir-male, it occurred to me there now
      remained no obstacle unless that the Baron might expect his daughter's
      husband to take the name of Bradwardine (which you know would be
      impossible in my case), and that this might be evaded by my assuming the
      title to which I had so good a right, and which, of course, would
      supersede that difficulty. If she was to be also Viscountess Bradwardine
      in her own right after her father's demise, so much the better; I could
      have no objection.'
    </p>
<p>
      'But, Fergus,' said Waverley, 'I had no idea that you had any affection
      for Miss Bradwardine, and you are always sneering at her father.'
    </p>
<p>
      'I have as much affection for Miss Bradwardine, my good friend, as I think
      it necessary to have for the future mistress of my family and the mother
      of my children. She is a very pretty, intelligent girl, and is certainly
      of one of the very first Lowland families; and, with a little of Flora's
      instructions and forming, will make a very good figure. As to her father,
      he is an original, it is true, and an absurd one enough; but he has given
      such severe lessons to Sir Hew Halbert, that dear defunct the Laird of
      Balmawhapple, and others, that nobody dare laugh at him, so his absurdity
      goes for nothing. I tell you there could have been no earthly objection—none.
      I had settled the thing entirely in my own mind.'
    </p>
<p>
      'But had you asked the Baron's consent,' said Waverley, 'or Rose's?'
    </p>
<p>
      'To what purpose? To have spoke to the Baron before I had assumed my title
      would have only provoked a premature and irritating discussion on the
      subject of the change of name, when, as Earl of Glennaquoich, I had only
      to propose to him to carry his d—d bear and bootjack party per pale,
      or in a scutcheon of pretence, or in a separate shield perhaps—any
      way that would not blemish my own coat of arms. And as to Rose, I don't
      see what objection she could have made if her father was satisfied.'
    </p>
<p>
      'Perhaps the same that your sister makes to me, you being satisfied.'
    </p>
<p>
      Fergus gave a broad stare at the comparison which this supposition
      implied, but cautiously suppressed the answer which rose to his tongue.
      'O, we should easily have arranged all that. So, sir, I craved a private
      interview, and this morning was assigned; and I asked you to meet me here,
      thinking, like a fool, that I should want your countenance as bride's-man.
      Well, I state my pretension—they are not denied; the promises so
      repeatedly made and the patent granted—they are acknowledged. But I
      propose, as a natural consequence, to assume the rank which the patent
      bestowed. I have the old story of the jealousy of C——and M——trumped
      up against me. I resist this pretext, and offer to procure their written
      acquiescence, in virtue of the date of my patent as prior to their silly
      claims; I assure you I would have had such a consent from them, if it had
      been at the point of the sword. And then out comes the real truth; and he
      dares to tell me to my face that my patent must be suppressed for the
      present, for fear of disgusting that rascally coward and faineant (naming
      the rival chief of his own clan), who has no better title to be a
      chieftain than I to be Emperor of China, and who is pleased to shelter his
      dastardly reluctance to come out, agreeable to his promise twenty times
      pledged, under a pretended jealousy of the Prince's partiality to me. And,
      to leave this miserable driveller without a pretence for his cowardice,
      the Prince asks it as a personal favour of me, forsooth, not to press my
      just and reasonable request at this moment. After this, put your faith in
      princes!'
    </p>
<p>
      'And did your audience end here?'
    </p>
<p>
      'End? O no! I was determined to leave him no pretence for his ingratitude,
      and I therefore stated, with all the composure I could muster,—for I
      promise you I trembled with passion,—the particular reasons I had
      for wishing that his Royal Highness would impose upon me any other mode of
      exhibiting my duty and devotion, as my views in life made what at any
      other time would have been a mere trifle at this crisis a severe
      sacrifice; and then I explained to him my full plan.'
    </p>
<p>
      'And what did the Prince answer?'
    </p>
<p>
      'Answer? why—it is well it is written, “Curse not the king, no, not
      in thy thought!”—why, he answered that truly he was glad I had made
      him my confidant, to prevent more grievous disappointment, for he could
      assure me, upon the word of a prince, that Miss Bradwardine's affections
      were engaged, and he was under a particular promise to favour them. “So,
      my dear Fergus,” said he, with his most gracious cast of smile, “as the
      marriage is utterly out of question, there need be no hurry, you know,
about the earldom.” And so he glided off and left me planté .'
    </p>
<p>
      'And what did you do?'
    </p>
<p>
      'I'll tell you what I COULD have done at that moment—sold myself to
      the devil or the Elector, whichever offered the dearest revenge. However,
      I am now cool. I know he intends to marry her to some of his rascally
      Frenchmen or his Irish officers, but I will watch them close; and let the
      man that would supplant me look well to himself. Bisogna coprirsi,
      Signor.'
    </p>
<p>
      After some further conversation, unnecessary to be detailed, Waverley took
      leave of the Chieftain, whose fury had now subsided into a deep and strong
      desire of vengeance, and returned home, scarce able to analyse the mixture
      of feelings which the narrative had awakened in his own bosom.
