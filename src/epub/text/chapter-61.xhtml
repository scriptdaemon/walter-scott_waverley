      CHAPTER LXI
    </h2>
<h3>
      A JOURNEY TO LONDON
    </h3>
<p>
      The family at Fasthwaite were soon attached to Edward. He had, indeed, that
      gentleness and urbanity which almost universally attracts corresponding
      kindness; and to their simple ideas his learning gave him consequence, and
      his sorrows interest. The last he ascribed, evasively, to the loss of a
      brother in the skirmish near Clifton; and in that primitive state of
      society, where the ties of affection were highly deemed of, his continued
      depression excited sympathy, but not surprise.
    </p>
<p>
      In the end of January his more lively powers were called out by the happy
      union of Edward Williams, the son of his host, with Cicely Jopson. Our
      hero would not cloud with sorrow the festivity attending the wedding of
      two persons to whom he was so highly obliged. He therefore exerted
      himself, danced, sung, played at the various games of the day, and was the
      blithest of the company. The next morning, however, he had more serious
      matters to think of.
    </p>
<p>
      The clergyman who had married the young couple was so much pleased with
      the supposed student of divinity, that he came next day from Penrith on
      purpose to pay him a visit. This might have been a puzzling chapter had he
      entered into any examination of our hero's supposed theological studies;
      but fortunately he loved better to hear and communicate the news of the
      day. He brought with him two or three old newspapers, in one of which
      Edward found a piece of intelligence that soon rendered him deaf to every
      word which the Reverend Mr. Twigtythe was saying upon the news from the
      north, and the prospect of the Duke's speedily overtaking and crushing the
      rebels. This was an article in these, or nearly these words:—
    </p>
<p>
      'Died at his house, in Hill Street, Berkeley Square, upon the 10th inst.,
      Richard Waverley, Esq., second son of Sir Giles Waverley of
      Waverley-Honour, etc. etc. He died of a lingering disorder, augmented by
      the unpleasant predicament of suspicion in which he stood, having been
      obliged to find bail to a high amount to meet an impending accusation of
      high-treason. An accusation of the same grave crime hangs over his elder
      brother, Sir Everard Waverley, the representative of that ancient family;
      and we understand the day of his trial will be fixed early in the next
      month, unless Edward Waverley, son of the deceased Richard, and heir to
      the Baronet, shall surrender himself to justice. In that case we are
      assured it is his Majesty's gracious purpose to drop further proceedings
      upon the charge against Sir Everard. This unfortunate young gentleman is
      ascertained to have been in arms in the Pretender's service, and to have
      marched along with the Highland troops into England. But he has not been
      heard of since the skirmish at Clifton, on the 18th December last.'
    </p>
<p>
      Such was this distracting paragraph. 'Good God!' exclaimed Waverley, 'am I
      then a parricide? Impossible! My father, who never showed the affection of
      a father while he lived, cannot have been so much affected by my supposed
      death as to hasten his own; no, I will not believe it, it were distraction
      to entertain for a moment such a horrible idea. But it were, if possible,
      worse than parricide to suffer any danger to hang over my noble and
      generous uncle, who has ever been more to me than a father, if such evil
      can be averted by any sacrifice on my part!'
    </p>
<p>
      While these reflections passed like the stings of scorpions through
      Waverley's sensorium, the worthy divine was startled in a long
      disquisition on the battle of Falkirk by the ghastliness which they
      communicated to his looks, and asked him if he was ill? Fortunately the
      bride, all smirk and blush, had just entered the room. Mrs. Williams was
      none of the brightest of women, but she was good-natured, and readily
      concluding that Edward had been shocked by disagreeable news in the
      papers, interfered so judiciously, that, without exciting suspicion, she
      drew off Mr. Twigtythe's attention, and engaged it until he soon after
      took his leave. Waverley then explained to his friends that he was under
      the necessity of going to London with as little delay as possible.
    </p>
<p>
      One cause of delay, however, did occur, to which Waverley had been very
      little accustomed. His purse, though well stocked when he first went to
      Tully-Veolan, had not been reinforced since that period; and although his
      life since had not been of a nature to exhaust it hastily, for he had
      lived chiefly with his friends or with the army, yet he found that, after
      settling with his kind landlord, he should be too poor to encounter the
      expense of travelling post. The best course, therefore, seemed to be to
      get into the great north road about Boroughbridge, and there take a place
      in the northern diligence, a huge old-fashioned tub, drawn by three
      horses, which completed the journey from Edinburgh to London (God willing,
      as the advertisement expressed it) in three weeks. Our hero, therefore,
      took an affectionate farewell of his Cumberland friends, whose kindness he
      promised never to forget, and tacitly hoped one day to acknowledge by
      substantial proofs of gratitude. After some petty difficulties and
      vexatious delays, and after putting his dress into a shape better
      befitting his rank, though perfectly plain and simple, he accomplished
      crossing the country, and found himself in the desired vehicle vis-a-vis
      to Mrs. Nosebag, the lady of Lieutenant Nosebag, adjutant and
      riding-master of the—dragoons, a jolly woman of about fifty, wearing
      a blue habit, faced with scarlet, and grasping a silver-mounted
      horse-whip.
    </p>
<p>
      This lady was one of those active members of society who take upon them
      faire le frais de la conversation. She had just returned from the north,
      and informed Edward how nearly her regiment had cut the petticoat people
      into ribands at Falkirk, 'only somehow there was one of those nasty,
      awkward marshes, that they are never without in Scotland, I think, and so
      our poor dear little regiment suffered something, as my Nosebag says, in
      that unsatisfactory affair. You, sir, have served in the dragoons?'
      Waverley was taken so much at unawares that he acquiesced.
    </p>
<p>
      'O, I knew it at once; I saw you were military from your air, and I was
      sure you could be none of the foot-wobblers, as my Nosebag calls them.
      What regiment, pray?' Here was a delightful question. Waverley, however,
      justly concluded that this good lady had the whole army-list by heart;
      and, to avoid detection by adhering to truth, answered, 'Gardiner's
      dragoons, ma'am; but I have retired some time.'
    </p>
<p>
      'O aye, those as won the race at the battle of Preston, as my Nosebag
      says. Pray, sir, were you there?'
    </p>
<p>
      'I was so unfortunate, madam,' he replied, 'as to witness that
      engagement.'
    </p>
<p>
      'And that was a misfortune that few of Gardiner's stood to witness, I
      believe, sir—ha! ha! ha! I beg your pardon; but a soldier's wife
      loves a joke.'
    </p>
<p>
      'Devil confound you,' thought Waverley: 'what infernal luck has penned me
      up with this inquisitive hag!'
    </p>
<p>
      Fortunately the good lady did not stick long to one subject. 'We are
      coming to Ferrybridge now,' she said, 'where there was a party of OURS
      left to support the beadles, and constables, and justices, and these sort
      of creatures that are examining papers and stopping rebels, and all that.'
      They were hardly in the inn before she dragged Waverley to the window,
      exclaiming, 'Yonder comes Corporal Bridoon, of our poor dear troop; he's
      coming with the constable man. Bridoon's one of my lambs, as Nosebag calls
      'ern. Come, Mr.—a—a—pray, what's your name, sir?'
    </p>
<p>
      'Butler, ma'am,' said Waverley, resolved rather to make free with the name
      of a former fellow-officer than run the risk of detection by inventing one
      not to be found in the regiment.
    </p>
<p>
      'O, you got a troop lately, when that shabby fellow, Waverley, went over
      to the rebels? Lord, I wish our old cross Captain Crump would go over to
      the rebels, that Nosebag might get the troop! Lord, what can Bridoon be
      standing swinging on the bridge for? I'll be hanged if he a'nt hazy, as
      Nosebag says. Come, sir, as you and I belong to the service, we'll go put
      the rascal in mind of his duty.'
    </p>
<p>
      Waverley, with feelings more easily conceived than described, saw himself
      obliged to follow this doughty female commander. The gallant trooper was
      as like a lamb as a drunk corporal of dragoons, about six feet high, with
      very broad shoulders, and very thin legs, not to mention a great scar
      across his nose, could well be. Mrs. Nosebag addressed him with something
      which, if not an oath, sounded very like one, and commanded him to attend
      to his duty. 'You be d—d for a——,' commenced the gallant
      cavalier; but, looking up in order to suit the action to the words, and
      also to enforce the epithet which he meditated with an adjective
      applicable to the party, he recognised the speaker, made his military
      salaam, and altered his tone. 'Lord love your handsome face, Madam
      Nosebag, is it you? Why, if a poor fellow does happen to fire a slug of a
      morning, I am sure you were never the lady to bring him to harm.'
    </p>
<p>
      'Well, you rascallion, go, mind your duty; this gentleman and I belong to
      the service; but be sure you look after that shy cock in the slouched hat
      that sits in the corner of the coach. I believe he's one of the rebels in
      disguise.'
    </p>
<p>
      'D—n her gooseberry wig,' said the corporal, when she was out of
      hearing, 'that gimlet-eyed jade—mother adjutant, as we call her—is
      a greater plague to the regiment than provost-marshal, sergeant-major, and
      old Hubble-de-Shuff, the colonel, into the bargain. Come, Master
      Constable, let's see if this shy cock, as she calls him (who, by the way,
      was a Quaker from Leeds, with whom Mrs. Nosebag had had some tart argument
      on the legality of bearing arms), will stand godfather to a sup of brandy,
      for your Yorkshire ale is cold on my stomach.'
    </p>
<p>
      The vivacity of this good lady, as it helped Edward out of this scrape,
      was like to have drawn him into one or two others. In every town where
      they stopped she wished to examine the corps de garde, if there was one,
      and once very narrowly missed introducing Waverley to a
      recruiting-sergeant of his own regiment. Then she Captain'd and Butler'd
      him till he was almost mad with vexation and anxiety; and never was he
      more rejoiced in his life at the termination of a journey than when the
      arrival of the coach in London freed him from the attentions of Madam
      Nosebag.
