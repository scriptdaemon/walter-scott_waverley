<h2>
      CHAPTER XXXV
    </h2>
<h3>
      A VOLUNTEER SIXTY YEARS SINCE
    </h3>
<p>
      On hearing the unwelcome sound of the drum, Major Melville hastily opened
      a sashed door and stepped out upon a sort of terrace which divided his
      house from the highroad from which the martial music proceeded. Waverley
      and his new friend followed him, though probably he would have dispensed
      with their attendance. They soon recognised in solemn march, first, the
      performer upon the drum; secondly, a large flag of four compartments, on
      which were inscribed the words, COVENANT, KIRK, KING, KINGDOMS. The person
      who was honoured with this charge was followed by the commander of the
      party, a thin, dark, rigid-looking man, about sixty years old. The
      spiritual pride, which in mine host of the Candlestick mantled in a sort
      of supercilious hypocrisy, was in this man's face elevated and yet
      darkened by genuine and undoubting fanaticism. It was impossible to behold
      him without imagination placing him in some strange crisis, where
      religious zeal was the ruling principle. A martyr at the stake, a soldier
      in the field, a lonely and banished wanderer consoled by the intensity and
      supposed purity of his faith under every earthly privation, perhaps a
      persecuting inquisitor, as terrific in power as unyielding in adversity;
      any of these seemed congenial characters to this personage. With these
      high traits of energy, there was something in the affected precision and
      solemnity of his deportment and discourse that bordered upon the
      ludicrous; so that, according to the mood of the spectator's mind and the
      light under which Mr. Gilfillan presented himself, one might have feared,
      admired, or laughed at him. His dress was that of a West-Country peasant,
      of better materials indeed than that of the lower rank, but in no respect
      affecting either the mode of the age or of the Scottish gentry at any
      period. His arms were a broadsword and pistols, which, from the antiquity
      of their appearance, might have seen the rout of Pentland or Bothwell
      Brigg.
    </p>
<p>
      As he came up a few steps to meet Major Melville, and touched solemnly,
      but slightly, his huge and over-brimmed blue bonnet, in answer to the
      Major, who had courteously raised a small triangular gold-laced hat,
      Waverley was irresistibly impressed with the idea that he beheld a leader
      of the Roundheads of yore in conference with one of Marlborough's
      captains.
    </p>
<p>
      The group of about thirty armed men who followed this gifted commander was
      of a motley description. They were in ordinary Lowland dresses, of
      different colours, which, contrasted with the arms they bore, gave them an
      irregular and mobbish appearance; so much is the eye accustomed to connect
      uniformity of dress with the military character. In front were a few who
      apparently partook of their leader's enthusiasm, men obviously to be
      feared in a combat, where their natural courage was exalted by religious
      zeal. Others puffed and strutted, filled with the importance of carrying
      arms and all the novelty of their situation, while the rest, apparently
      fatigued with their march, dragged their limbs listlessly along, or
      straggled from their companions to procure such refreshments as the
      neighbouring cottages and alehouses afforded. Six grenadiers of
      Ligonier's, thought the Major to himself, as his mind reverted to his own
      military experience, would have sent all these fellows to the right about.
    </p>
<p>
      Greeting, however, Mr. Gilfillan civilly, he requested to know if he had
      received the letter he had sent to him upon his march, and could undertake
      the charge of the state prisoner whom he there mentioned as far as
      Stirling Castle. 'Yea,' was the concise reply of the Cameronian leader, in
      a voice which seemed to issue from the very penetralia of his person.
    </p>
<p>
      'But your escort, Mr. Gilfillan, is not so strong as I expected,' said
      Major Melville.
    </p>
<p>
      'Some of the people,' replied Gilfillan, 'hungered and were athirst by the
      way, and tarried until their poor souls were refreshed with the word.'
    </p>
<p>
      'I am sorry, sir,' replied the Major, 'you did not trust to your
      refreshing your men at Cairnvreckan; whatever my house contains is at the
      command of persons employed in the service.'
    </p>
<p>
      'It was not of creature-comforts I spake,' answered the Covenanter,
      regarding Major Melville with something like a smile of contempt;
      'howbeit, I thank you; but the people remained waiting upon the precious
      Mr. Jabesh Rentowel for the out-pouring of the afternoon exhortation.'
    </p>
<p>
      'And have you, sir,' said the Major, 'when the rebels are about to spread
      themselves through this country, actually left a great part of your
      command at a fieldpreaching?'
    </p>
<p>
      Gilfillan again smiled scornfully as he made this indirect answer—'Even
      thus are the children of this world wiser in their generation than the
      children of light!'
    </p>
<p>
      'However, sir,' said the Major, 'as you are to take charge of this
      gentleman to Stirling, and deliver him, with these papers, into the hands
      of Governor Blakeney, I beseech you to observe some rules of military
      discipline upon your march. For example, I would advise you to keep your
      men more closely together, and that each in his march should cover his
      file-leader, instead of straggling like geese upon a common; and, for fear
      of surprise, I further recommend to you to form a small advance-party of
      your best men, with a single vidette in front of the whole march, so that
      when you approach a village or a wood'—(here the Major interrupted
      himself)—'But as I don't observe you listen to me, Mr. Gilfillan, I
      suppose I need not give myself the trouble to say more upon the subject.
      You are a better judge, unquestionably, than I am of the measures to be
      pursued; but one thing I would have you well aware of, that you are to
      treat this gentleman, your prisoner, with no rigour nor incivility, and
      are to subject him to no other restraint than is necessary for his
      security.'
    </p>
<p>
      'I have looked into my commission,' said Mr. Gilfillan,' subscribed by a
      worthy and professing nobleman, William, Earl of Glencairn; nor do I find
      it therein set down that I am to receive any charges or commands anent my
      doings from Major William Melville of Cairnvreckan.'
    </p>
<p>
      Major Melville reddened even to the well-powdered ears which appeared
      beneath his neat military sidecurls, the more so as he observed Mr. Morton
      smile at the same moment. 'Mr. Gilfillan,' he answered, with some
      asperity, 'I beg ten thousand pardons for interfering with a person of
      your importance. I thought, however, that as you have been bred a grazier,
      if I mistake not, there might be occasion to remind you of the difference
      between Highlanders and Highland cattle; and if you should happen to meet
      with any gentleman who has seen service, and is disposed to speak upon the
      subject, I should still imagine that listening to him would do you no sort
      of harm. But I have done, and have only once more to recommend this
      gentleman to your civility as well as to your custody. Mr. Waverley, I am
      truly sorry we should part in this way; but I trust, when you are again in
      this country, I may have an opportunity to render Cairnvreckan more
      agreeable than circumstances have permitted on this occasion.'
    </p>
<p>
      So saying, he shook our hero by the hand. Morton also took an affectionate
      farewell, and Waverley, having mounted his horse, with a musketeer leading
      it by the bridle and a file upon each side to prevent his escape, set
      forward upon the march with Gilfillan and his party. Through the little
      village they were accompanied with the shouts of the children, who cried
      out, 'Eh! see to the Southland gentleman that's gaun to be hanged for
      shooting lang John Mucklewrath, the smith!
