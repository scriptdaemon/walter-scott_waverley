      CHAPTER XVIII
    </h2>
<h3>
      WAVERLEY PROCEEDS ON HIS JOURNEY
    </h3>
<p>
      When Edward had collected his scattered recollection, he was surprised to
      observe the cavern totally deserted. Having arisen and put his dress in
      some order, he looked more accurately round him; but all was still
      solitary. If it had not been for the decayed brands of the fire, now sunk
      into grey ashes, and the remnants of the festival, consisting of bones
      half burnt and half gnawed, and an empty keg or two, there remained no
      traces of Donald and his band. When Waverley sallied forth to the entrance
      of the cave, he perceived that the point of rock, on which remained the
      marks of last night's beacon, was accessible by a small path, either
      natural or roughly hewn in the rock, along the little inlet of water which
      ran a few yards up into the cavern, where, as in a wetdock, the skiff
      which brought him there the night before was still lying moored. When he
      reached the small projecting platform on which the beacon had been
      established, he would have believed his further progress by land
      impossible, only that it was scarce probable but what the inhabitants of
      the cavern had some mode of issuing from it otherwise than by the lake.
      Accordingly, he soon observed three or four shelving steps, or ledges of
      rock, at the very extremity of the little platform; and, making use of
      them as a staircase, he clambered by their means around the projecting
      shoulder of the crag on which the cavern opened, and, descending with some
      difficulty on the other side, he gained the wild and precipitous shores of
      a Highland loch, about four miles in length and a mile and a half across,
      surrounded by heathy and savage mountains, on the crests of which the
      morning mist was still sleeping.
    </p>
<p>
      Looking back to the place from which he came, he could not help admiring
      the address which had adopted a retreat of such seclusion and secrecy. The
      rock, round the shoulder of which he had turned by a few imperceptible
      notches, that barely afforded place for the foot, seemed, in looking back
      upon it, a huge precipice, which barred all further passage by the shores
      of the lake in that direction. There could be no possibility, the breadth
      of the lake considered, of descrying the entrance of the narrow and
      low-browed cave from the other side; so that, unless the retreat had been
      sought for with boats, or disclosed by treachery, it might be a safe and
      secret residence to its garrison as long as they were supplied with
      provisions. Having satisfied his curiosity in these particulars, Waverley
      looked around for Evan Dhu and his attendants, who, he rightly judged,
      would be at no great distance, whatever might have become of Donald Bean
      Lean and his party, whose mode of life was, of course, liable to sudden
      migrations of abode. Accordingly, at the distance of about half a mile, he
      beheld a Highlander (Evan apparently) angling in the lake, with another
      attending him, whom, from the weapon which he shouldered, he recognised
      for his friend with the battle-axe.
    </p>
<p>
      Much nearer to the mouth of the cave he heard the notes of a lively Gaelic
      song, guided by which, in a sunny recess, shaded by a glittering
      birch-tree, and carpeted with a bank of firm white sand, he found the
      damsel of the cavern, whose lay had already reached him, busy, to the best
      of her power, in arranging to advantage a morning repast of milk, eggs,
      barley-bread, fresh butter, and honey-comb. The poor girl had already made
      a circuit of four miles that morning in search of the eggs, of the meal
      which baked her cakes, and of the other materials of the breakfast, being
      all delicacies which she had to beg or borrow from distant cottagers. The
      followers of Donald Bean Lean used little food except the flesh of the
      animals which they drove away from the Lowlands; bread itself was a
      delicacy seldom thought of, because hard to be obtained, and all the
      domestic accommodations of milk, poultry, butter, etc., were out of the
      question in this Scythian camp. Yet it must not be omitted that, although
      Alice had occupied a part of the morning in providing those accommodations
      for her guest which the cavern did not afford, she had secured time also
      to arrange her own person in her best trim. Her finery was very simple. A
      short russet-coloured jacket and a petticoat of scanty longitude was her
      whole dress; but these were clean, and neatly arranged. A piece of scarlet
      embroidered cloth, called the snood, confined her hair, which fell over it
      in a profusion of rich dark curls. The scarlet plaid, which formed part of
      her dress, was laid aside, that it might not impede her activity in
      attending the stranger. I should forget Alice's proudest ornament were I
      to omit mentioning a pair of gold ear-rings and a golden rosary, which her
      father (for she was the daughter of Donald Bean Lean) had brought from
      France, the plunder, probably, of some battle or storm.
    </p>
<p>
      Her form, though rather large for her years, was very well proportioned,
      and her demeanour had a natural and rustic grace, with nothing of the
      sheepishness of an ordinary peasant. The smiles, displaying a row of teeth
      of exquisite whiteness, and the laughing eyes, with which, in dumb show,
      she gave Waverley that morning greeting which she wanted English words to
      express, might have been interpreted by a coxcomb, or perhaps by a young
      soldier who, without being such, was conscious of a handsome person, as
      meant to convey more than the courtesy of an hostess. Nor do I take it
      upon me to say that the little wild mountaineer would have welcomed any
      staid old gentleman advanced in life, the Baron of Bradwardine, for
      example, with the cheerful pains which she bestowed upon Edward's
      accommodation. She seemed eager to place him by the meal which she had so
      sedulously arranged, and to which she now added a few bunches of
      cranberries, gathered in an adjacent morass. Having had the satisfaction
      of seeing him seated at his breakfast, she placed herself demurely upon a
      stone at a few yards' distance, and appeared to watch with great
      complacency for some opportunity of serving him.
    </p>
<p>
      Evan and his attendant now returned slowly along the beach, the latter
      bearing a large salmon-trout, the produce of the morning's sport, together
      with the angling-rod, while Evan strolled forward, with an easy,
      self-satisfied, and important gait, towards the spot where Waverley was so
      agreeably employed at the breakfast-table. After morning greetings had
      passed on both sides, and Evan, looking at Waverley, had said something in
      Gaelic to Alice, which made her laugh, yet colour up to her eyes, through
      a complexion well en-browned by sun and wind, Evan intimated his commands
      that the fish should be prepared for breakfast. A spark from the lock of
      his pistol produced a light, and a few withered fir branches were quickly
      in flame, and as speedily reduced to hot embers, on which the trout was
      broiled in large slices. To crown the repast, Evan produced from the
      pocket of his short jerkin a large scallop shell, and from under the folds
      of his plaid a ram's horn full of whisky. Of this he took a copious dram,
      observing he had already taken his MORNING with Donald Bean Lean before
      his departure; he offered the same cordial to Alice and to Edward, which
      they both declined. With the bounteous air of a lord, Evan then proffered
      the scallop to Dugald Mahony, his attendant, who, without waiting to be
      asked a second time, drank it off with great gusto. Evan then prepared to
      move towards the boat, inviting Waverley to attend him. Meanwhile, Alice
      had made up in a small basket what she thought worth removing, and
      flinging her plaid around her, she advanced up to Edward, and with the
      utmost simplicity, taking hold of his hand, offered her cheek to his
      salute, dropping at the same time her little curtsy. Evan, who was
      esteemed a wag among the mountain fair, advanced as if to secure a similar
      favour; but Alice, snatching up her basket, escaped up the rocky bank as
      fleetly as a roe, and, turning round and laughing, called something out to
      him in Gaelic, which he answered in the same tone and language; then,
      waving her hand to Edward, she resumed her road, and was soon lost among
      the thickets, though they continued for some time to hear her lively
      carol, as she proceeded gaily on her solitary journey.
    </p>
<p>
      They now again entered the gorge of the cavern, and stepping into the
      boat, the Highlander pushed off, and, taking advantage of the morning
      breeze, hoisted a clumsy sort of sail, while Evan assumed the helm,
      directing their course, as it appeared to Waverley, rather higher up the
      lake than towards the place of his embarkation on the preceding night. As
      they glided along the silver mirror, Evan opened the conversation with a
      panegyric upon Alice, who, he said, was both CANNY and FENDY; and was, to
      the boot of all that, the best dancer of a strathspey in the whole strath.
      Edward assented to her praises so far as he understood them, yet could not
      help regretting that she was condemned to such a perilous and dismal life.
    </p>
<p>
      'Oich! for that,' said Evan, 'there is nothing in Perthshire that she need
      want, if she ask her father to fetch it, unless it be too hot or too
      heavy.'
    </p>
<p>
      'But to be the daughter of a cattle-stealer—a common thief!' 'Common
      thief!—no such thing: Donald Bean Lean never LIFTED less than a
      drove in his life.'
    </p>
<p>
      'Do you call him an uncommon thief, then?'
    </p>
<p>
      'No; he that steals a cow from a poor widow, or a stirk from a cotter, is
      a thief; he that lifts a drove from a Sassenach laird is a
      gentleman-drover. And, besides, to take a tree from the forest, a salmon
      from the river, a deer from the hill, or a cow from a Lowland strath, is
      what no Highlander need ever think shame upon.'
    </p>
<p>
      'But what can this end in, were he taken in such an appropriation?'
    </p>
<p>
      'To be sure he would DIE FOR THE LAW, as many a pretty man has done before
      him.'
    </p>
<p>
      'Die for the law!'
    </p>
<p>
      'Ay; that is, with the law, or by the law; be strapped up on the KIND
      gallows of Crieff, [Footnote: See Note 16.] where his father died, and his
      goodsire died, and where I hope he'll live to die himsell, if he's not
      shot, or slashed, in a creagh.'
    </p>
<p>
      'You HOPE such a death for your friend, Evan?'
    </p>
<p>
      'And that do I e'en; would you have me wish him to die on a bundle of wet
      straw in yon den of his, like a mangy tyke?'
    </p>
<p>
      'But what becomes of Alice, then?'
    </p>
<p>
      'Troth, if such an accident were to happen, as her father would not need
      her help ony langer, I ken nought to hinder me to marry her mysell.'
    </p>
<p>
      'Gallantly resolved,' said Edward; 'but, in the meanwhile, Evan, what has
      your father-in-law (that shall be, if he have the good fortune to be
      hanged) done with the Baron's cattle?'
    </p>
<p>
      'Oich,' answered Evan, 'they were all trudging before your lad and Allan
      Kennedy before the sun blinked ower Ben Lawers this morning; and they'll
      be in the pass of Bally-Brough by this time, in their way back to the
      parks of Tully-Veolan, all but two, that were unhappily slaughtered before
      I got last night to Uaimh an Ri.'
    </p>
<p>
      'And where are we going, Evan, if I may be so bold as to ask?' said
      Waverley.
    </p>
<p>
      'Where would you be ganging, but to the Laird's ain house of Glennaquoich?
      Ye would not think to be in his country, without ganging to see him? It
      would be as much as a man's life's worth.'
    </p>
<p>
      'And are we far from Glennaquoich?'
    </p>
<p>
      'But five bits of miles; and Vich Ian Vohr will meet us.'
    </p>
<p>
      In about half an hour they reached the upper end of the lake, where, after
      landing Waverley, the two Highanders drew the boat into a little creek
      among thick flags and reeds, where it lay perfectly concealed. The oars
      they put in another place of concealment, both for the use of Donald Bean
      Lean probably, when his occasions should next bring him to that place.
    </p>
<p>
      The travellers followed for some time a delightful opening into the hills,
      down which a little brook found its way to the lake. When they had pursued
      their walk a short distance, Waverley renewed his questions about their
      host of the cavern.
    </p>
<p>
      'Does he always reside in that cave?'
    </p>
<p>
      'Out, no! it's past the skill of man to tell where he's to be found at a'
      times; there's not a dern nook, or cove, or corrie, in the whole country
      that he's not acquainted with.'
    </p>
<p>
      'And do others beside your master shelter him?'
    </p>
<p>
      'My master? MY master is in Heaven,' answered Evan, haughtily; and then
      immediately assuming his usual civility of manner, 'but you mean my Chief;—no,
      he does not shelter Donald Bean Lean, nor any that are like him; he only
      allows him (with a smile) wood and water.'
    </p>
<p>
      'No great boon, I should think, Evan, when both seem to be very plenty.'
    </p>
<p>
      'Ah! but ye dinna see through it. When I say wood and water, I mean the
      loch and the land; and I fancy Donald would be put till 't if the Laird
      were to look for him wi' threescore men in the wood of Kailychat yonder;
      and if our boats, with a score or twa mair, were to come down the loch to
      Uaimh an Ri, headed by mysell, or ony other pretty man.'
    </p>
<p>
      'But suppose a strong party came against him from the Low Country, would
      not your Chief defend him?'
    </p>
<p>
      'Na, he would not ware the spark of a flint for him—if they came
      with the law.'
    </p>
<p>
      'And what must Donald do, then?'
    </p>
<p>
      'He behoved to rid this country of himsell, and fall back, it may be, over
      the mount upon Letter Scriven.'
    </p>
<p>
      'And if he were pursued to that place?'
    </p>
<p>
      'I'se warrant he would go to his cousin's at Rannoch.'
    </p>
<p>
      'Well, but if they followed him to Rannoch?'
    </p>
<p>
      'That,' quoth Evan, 'is beyond all belief; and, indeed, to tell you the
      truth, there durst not a Lowlander in all Scotland follow the fray a
      gun-shot beyond Bally-Brough, unless he had the help of the Sidier Dhu.'
    </p>
<p>
      'Whom do you call so?'
    </p>
<p>
      'The Sidier Dhu? the black soldier; that is what they call the independent
      companies that were raised to keep peace and law in the Highlands. Vich
      Ian Vohr commanded one of them for five years, and I was sergeant mysell,
      I shall warrant ye. They call them Sidier Dhu because they wear the
      tartans, as they call your men—King George's men—Sidier Roy,
      or red soldiers.'
    </p>
<p>
      'Well, but when you were in King George's pay, Evan, you were surely King
      George's soldiers?'
    </p>
<p>
      'Troth, and you must ask Vich Ian Vohr about that; for we are for his
      king, and care not much which o' them it is. At ony rate, nobody can say
      we are King George's men now, when we have not seen his pay this
      twelve-month.'
    </p>
<p>
      This last argument admitted of no reply, nor did Edward attempt any; he
      rather chose to bring back the discourse to Donald Bean Lean. 'Does Donald
      confine himself to cattle, or does he LIFT, as you call it, anything else
      that comes in his way?'
    </p>
<p>
      'Troth, he's nae nice body, and he'll just tak onything, but most readily
      cattle, horse, or live Christians; for sheep are slow of travel, and
      inside plenishing is cumbrous to carry, and not easy to put away for
      siller in this country.'
    </p>
<p>
      'But does he carry off men and women?'
    </p>
<p>
      'Out, ay. Did not ye hear him speak o' the Perth bailie? It cost that body
      five hundred merks ere he got to the south of Bally-Brough. And ance
      Donald played a pretty sport. [Footnote: See Note 17.] There was to be a
      blythe bridal between the Lady Cramfeezer, in the howe o' the Mearns (she
      was the auld laird's widow, and no sae young as she had been hersell), and
      young Gilliewhackit, who had spent his heirship and movables, like a
      gentleman, at cock-matches, bull-baitings, horse-races, and the like. Now,
      Donald Bean Lean, being aware that the bridegroom was in request, and
      wanting to cleik the cunzie (that is, to hook the siller), he cannily
      carried off Gilliewhackit ae night when he was riding dovering hame (wi'
      the malt rather abune the meal), and with the help of his gillies he gat
      him into the hills with the speed of light, and the first place he wakened
      in was the cove of Uaimh an Ri. So there was old to do about ransoming the
      bridegroom; for Donald would not lower a farthing of a thousand punds—'
    </p>
<p>
      'The devil!'
    </p>
<p>
      'Punds Scottish, ye shall understand. And the lady had not the siller if
      she had pawned her gown; and they applied to the governor o' Stirling
      castle, and to the major o' the Black Watch; and the governor said it was
      ower far to the northward, and out of his district; and the major said his
      men were gane hame to the shearing, and he would not call them out before
      the victual was got in for all the Cramfeezers in Christendom, let alane
      the Mearns, for that it would prejudice the country. And in the meanwhile
      ye'll no hinder Gilliewhackit to take the small-pox. There was not the
      doctor in Perth or Stirling would look near the poor lad; and I cannot
      blame them, for Donald had been misguggled by ane of these doctors about
      Paris, and he swore he would fling the first into the loch that he catched
      beyond the pass. However some cailliachs (that is, old women) that were
      about Donald's hand nursed Gilliewhackit sae weel that, between the free
      open air in the cove and the fresh whey, deil an he did not recover maybe
      as weel as if he had been closed in a glazed chamber and a bed with
      curtains, and fed with red wine and white meat. And Donald was sae vexed
      about it that, when he was stout and weel, he even sent him free home, and
      said he would be pleased with onything they would like to gie him for the
      plague and trouble which he had about Gilliewhackit to an unkenn'd degree.
      And I cannot tell you precisely how they sorted; but they agreed sae right
      that Donald was invited to dance at the wedding in his Highland trews, and
      they said that there was never sae meikle siller clinked in his purse
      either before or since. And to the boot of all that, Gilliewhackit said
      that, be the evidence what it liked, if he had the luck to be on Donald's
      inquest, he would bring him in guilty of nothing whatever, unless it were
      wilful arson or murder under trust.'
    </p>
<p>
      With such bald and disjointed chat Evan went on illustrating the existing
      state of the Highlands, more perhaps to the amusement of Waverley than
      that of our readers. At length, after having marched over bank and brae,
      moss and heather, Edward, though not unacquainted with the Scottish
      liberality in computing distance, began to think that Evan's five miles
      were nearly doubled. His observation on the large measure which the
      Scottish allowed of their land, in comparison to the computation of their
      money, was readily answered by Evan with the old jest, 'The deil take them
      wha have the least pint stoup.'
    </p>
<blockquote>
<p>
        [Footnote: The Scotch are liberal in computing their land and liquor;
        the Scottish pint corresponds to two English quarts. As for their coin,
        every one knows the couplet—
      </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">         How can the rogues pretend to sense?
         Their pound is only twenty pence.]</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
      And now the report of a gun was heard, and a sportsman was seen, with his
      dogs and attendant, at the upper end of the glen. 'Shough,' said Dugald
      Mahony, 'tat's ta Chief.'
    </p>
<p>
      'It is not,' said Evan, imperiously. 'Do you think he would come to meet a
      Sassenach duinhe-wassel in such a way as that?'
    </p>
<p>
      But as they approached a little nearer, he said, with an appearance of
      mortification, 'And it is even he, sure enough; and he has not his tail on
      after all; there is no living creature with him but Callum Beg.'
    </p>
<p>
      In fact, Fergus Mac-Ivor, of whom a Frenchman might have said as truly as
      of any man in the Highlands, 'Qu'il connoit bien ses gens' had no idea of
      raising himself in the eyes of an English young man of fortune by
      appearing with a retinue of idle Highlanders disproportioned to the
      occasion. He was well aware that such an unnecessary attendance would seem
      to Edward rather ludicrous than respectable; and, while few men were more
      attached to ideas of chieftainship and feudal power, he was, for that very
      reason, cautious of exhibiting external marks of dignity, unless at the
      time and in the manner when they were most likely to produce an imposing
      effect. Therefore, although, had he been to receive a brother chieftain,
      he would probably have been attended by all that retinue which Evan
      described with so much unction, he judged it more respectable to advance
      to meet Waverley with a single attendant, a very handsome Highland boy,
      who carried his master's shooting-pouch and his broadsword, without which
      he seldom went abroad.
    </p>
<p>
      When Fergus and Waverley met, the latter was struck with the peculiar
      grace and dignity of the Chieftain's figure. Above the middle size and
      finely proportioned, the Highland dress, which he wore in its simplest
      mode, set off his person to great advantage. He wore the trews, or close
      trowsers, made of tartan, chequed scarlet and white; in other particulars
      his dress strictly resembled Evan's, excepting that he had no weapon save
      a dirk, very richly mounted with silver. His page, as we have said,
      carried his claymore; and the fowling-piece, which he held in his hand,
      seemed only designed for sport. He had shot in the course of his walk some
      young wild-ducks, as, though CLOSE TIME was then unknown, the broods of
      grouse were yet too young for the sportsman. His countenance was decidedly
      Scottish, with all the peculiarities of the northern physiognomy, but yet
      had so little of its harshness and exaggeration that it would have been
      pronounced in any country extremely handsome. The martial air of the
      bonnet, with a single eagle's feather as a distinction, added much to the
      manly appearance of his head, which was besides ornamented with a far more
      natural and graceful cluster of close black curls than ever were exposed
      to sale in Bond Street.

      An air of openness and affability increased the favorable impression
      derived from this handsome and dignified exterior. Yet a skilful
      physiognomist would have been less satisfied with the countenance on the
      second than on the first view. The eyebrow and upper lip bespoke something
      of the habit of peremptory command and decisive superiority. Even his
      courtesy, though open, frank, and unconstrained, seemed to indicate a
      sense of personal importance; and, upon any check or accidental
      excitation, a sudden, though transient lour of the eye showed a hasty,
      haughty, and vindictive temper, not less to be dreaded because it seemed
      much under its owner's command. In short, the countenance of the Chieftain
      resembled a smiling summer's day, in which, notwithstanding, we are made
      sensible by certain, though slight signs that it may thunder and lighten
      before the close of evening.

      It was not, however, upon their first meeting that Edward had an
      opportunity of making these less favourable remarks. The Chief received
      him as a friend of the Baron of Bradwardine, with the utmost expression of
      kindness and obligation for the visit; upbraided him gently with choosing
      so rude an abode as he had done the night before; and entered into a
      lively conversation with him about Donald Bean's housekeeping, but without
      the least hint as to his predatory habits, or the immediate occasion of
      Waverley's visit, a topic which, as the Chief did not introduce it, our
      hero also avoided. While they walked merrily on towards the house of
      Glennaquoich, Evan, who now fell respectfully into the rear, followed with
      Callum Beg and Dugald Mahony.

      We shall take the opportunity to introduce the reader to some particulars
      of Fergus Mac-Ivor's character and history, which were not completely
      known to Waverley till after a connection which, though arising from a
      circumstance so casual, had for a length of time the deepest influence
      upon his character, actions, and prospects. But this, being an important
      subject, must form the commencement of a new chapter.
