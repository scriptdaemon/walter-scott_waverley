			<h3> TO <br/> <br/>THE KING’S MOST GRAC<abbr class="initialism">IOU</abbr>S MAJESTY. </h3>
			<p>SIRE,</p>
			<p>The Author of this collection of Works of Fiction would not have presumed to solicit for them your Majesty’s august patronage, were it not that the perusal has been supposed in some instances to have succeeded in amusing hours of relaxation, or relieving those of languor, pain, or anxiety, and therefore must have so far aided the warmest wish of your Majesty’s heart, by contributing in however small a degree to the happiness of your people.</p>
			<p>They are therefore humbly dedicated to your Majesty, agreeably to your gracious permission, by</p>
			<p>Your Majesty’s Dutiful Subject, <br/> WALTER SCOTT.</p>
			<p>ABBOTSFORD, 1st January, 1829.</p>
